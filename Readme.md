  - In this tutorial, we will build SVM for multi-class classification. 
  - SVM does not support multiclass classification natively. 
  - Two commonly used approaches that extend SVM for multiclass classification are 
    - One-vs-One and 
    - One-vs-Rest. 
  - In this exercise we apply multiclass classification using SVM to classify number 0-10 from MNIST dataset. 


### Getting Started

1. Change the directory to the `Tutorial` folder.
2. Look for the  instructions (e.g. [Tutorial 1 Readme](TutorialX/Readme.md)) for installing dependencies. 
3. You may execute the `main` file in python or ipynb fileformat. 

* Course materials (such as HW and lecture notes) maybe provided in each `Tutorial` folder. 
* Each tutorial runs independently in its own environment.
